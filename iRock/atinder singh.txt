Vannakam sir, 

Today on this special day everyone will say lot about u but I would reveal two things which I might not have told anybody ever.
First, I have attended lot of OEM meetings with you at honda, maruti and ford and when you're interacting with their heads and my mind always
compares you with their heads. And I always found you on the upper side in terms of communication, aggression and in all aspects.

Secondly, your north team really loves and respects you but they are  unable express their feelings towards you due to language barrier and today
I tried to bridge this gap. I always thought that I was biggest fan of yours but I was proved wrong when I saw the response of juniors/trainees for Thanks Arsu Program in January 2020. 

Also I bring along a complain from families of north employees, that you never visit us for family get-togethers and our discussed IMA meeting at haridwar. I have given 
assurity on your behalf that we will arrange for a get-together whenever you visit us in Delhi.


At last, Thank you for changing so many lives. Best Wishes for your second beginning.
